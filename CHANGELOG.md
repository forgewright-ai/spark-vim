# Changelog

## 1.0.0

- spark in vim, spark-micro's whole shape under one key: the `spark> `
  prompt (complete at the cursor, rewrite the selection or the file, `?`
  asks in a pane, `??` goes on in its thread, `ledger [clear]`), the pane
  keys (q, Enter to a quote, a applies code, d declines to the ledger),
  and the splice safety -- an answer whose text moved meanwhile opens in
  a pane instead of being spliced over the wrong place.
- Everything is one call to `spark edit` with the text on stdin: the
  filetype, the basename and the about-hint travel as hints, the path
  never does; the plugin speaks no HTTP and sees no token.
- Legacy vimscript on vim 8.2's `+job`/`+channel`; the pty test
  (`tests/vim_pty.py`) drives a real vim against a stub spark,
  spark-micro's cases ported whole; CI runs it on Ubuntu, Arch and macOS.
